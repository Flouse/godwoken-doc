It is intuitive from the user\u2019s point of view and more importantly, it only takes little work to change the code in Godwoken mem-pool implementation.\nWith the gasless feature enabled, when Godwoken block_producer sees a transaction with 0 gas price, they will first check if the transaction is a valid gasless transaction, if it is, the block producer will reveal the real gas price (the sponsoring gas price) from this transaction, and sort the transaction in the mem-pool according to this real price, the rest work just becomes the same with normal transactions.\nBut How does one transaction with 0 gas price become a valid gasless transaction?

The paymaster could check the block timestamp to reject sponsoring those users who have passed the expired time.\nAnother example might be a blockchain gaming dApp that decides every new user will have the first 100 transactions fee-free. When the user sends the 101st transaction, the paymaster will stop sponsoring the gas fee.\nYou can even have an interesting idea to leverage the gasless feature to let users pay the gas fee with non-native tokens. Say, one transaction can be sponsored only if the user owns some NFTs or some tokens you issued.\nThese ideas can also combine with some basic whitelist mechanisms. For example, when a user reaches a certain level, his/her public key will automatically join into the paymaster\u2019s whitelist.
