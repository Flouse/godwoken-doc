Deposit and withdrawal is a special messaging mechanism between layer 1 and layer 2 with assets transfer function. Users can deposit assets from layer1 (CKB) to layer2 (Godwoken), or withdraw assets from layer 2 to layer 1.

## Deposit

A deposit request is created by sending a layer1 transaction. This transaction generates a cell with a special lock - deposit lock. The block producer will collect these cells and process the deposit requests in the blocks. It will unlock the deposit cells, move the assets under the custodian lockï¼Œupdate layer2 state and submit layer1 transactions in the blocks. These transactions are checked by the layer1 script, so the block producer cannot take the assets away.

The deposit cell:

``` yaml
lock:
  code_hash:    (deposit lock's code hash),
  hash_type:    Type,
  args: (rollup_type_hash(32 bytes) | DepositLockArgs)
capacity:   (deposit CKB),
type_:  (none or SUDT script)
data:   (none or SUDT amount)
```

The `lock` field of the deposit cell uses deposit lock. The first 32 bytes of `args` is a unique value associated with the rollup instance. The data structure `DepositLockArgs` denotes to which layer2 account the user deposited. The `capacity` is the total amount of CKB user deposited. The `type_` and `data` fields follow the CKB Simple UDT format. All these fields enable users to deposit Simple UDT assets to layer2.

```
table DepositLockArgs {
    // layer1 lock hash
    owner_lock_hash: Byte32,
    layer2_lock: Script,
    cancel_timeout: Uint64,
    registry_id: Uint32,
}
```

`DepositLockArgs` represents the script and `registry_id` of layer2 account, currently, which currently supports only the ETH registry. Users can cancel deposit after `cancel_timeout`, which can be used by block producer to reject packed deposit cell when the deposited cell contains invalid data.

## Custodian Cell

Deposit cells are converted to custodian cells when assets are deposited to layer2. Custodian cells are protected by the custodian lock, which restricts that assets can only be transferred out when user makes withdrawals.

The custodian cell:

``` yaml
lock:
  code_hash:    (custodian lock's code hash),
  hash_type:    Type,
  args: (rollup_type_hash(32 bytes) | CustodianLockArgs)
capacity:   (deposit CKB),
type_:  (none or SUDT script)
data:   (none or SUDT amount)
```

The first 32 bytes of `args` are unique values associated with the rollup instance. `CustodianLockArgs` records the deposit info. `capacity` is the amount of CKB, and the `type_` and `data` fields are following CKB Simple UDT format.

```
table CustodianLockArgs {
    deposit_block_hash: Byte32,
    deposit_block_number: Uint64,
    deposit_lock_args: DepositLockArgs,
}
```

`CustodianLockArgs` saves the entire deposit info, `deposit_lock_args` is args from the original deposit cell, `deposit_block_hash` and `deposit_block_number` denotes the layer2 block that include the deposit.

CKB requires `capacity` to cover the cost of the cell, the `capacity` of the deposited cell must also cover the custodian cell, so the minimal deposit CKB that Godwoken allows is as follows:

* Deposit CKB: 298 CKB
* Deposit CKB and Simple UDT: 379 CKB


## Withdrawal

User signs withdrawal requests and sends them to the block producer. The block producer will process these requests in the blocks, update layer2 state and convert custodian cells to withdrawal cells in block submission layer1 transactions.

The withdrawal cell:

``` yaml
lock:
  code_hash:    (withdrawal lock's code hash),
  hash_type:    Type,
  args: (rollup_type_hash(32 bytes) | WithdrawalLockArgs (n bytes) | len (4 bytes) | layer1 owner lock (n bytes))
capacity:   (CKB amount),
type_:  (none or SUDT script)
data:   (none or SUDT amount)
```

Withdrawal lock guarantees the user can unlock this cell after `finality blocks`.

```
struct WithdrawalLockArgs {
    withdrawal_block_hash: Byte32,
    withdrawal_block_number: Uint64,
    account_script_hash: Byte32,
    // layer1 lock to withdraw after challenge period
    owner_lock_hash: Byte32,
}
```

`withdrawal_block_hash` and `withdrawal_block_number` record the layer2 block including the withdrawal. `account_script_hash` denotes the layer2 account. `owner_lock_hash` denotes the layer1 lock user used to unlock the cell.

CKB requires `capacity` to cover the cost of the cell, so the minimal withdrawal CKB that Godwoken allows is as follows:

* Withdrawal CKB: 266 CKB
* Withdrawal CKB and Simple UDT: 347 CKB
