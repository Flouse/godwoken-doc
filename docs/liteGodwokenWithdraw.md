This tutorial assumes users have already downloaded a web3 wallet, such as MetaMask, and that users have CKB or tokens in the wallet.

Visit [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to download the wallet. For more information about the concepts of Godwoken and CKB, refer to [Nervos CKB](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/introduction) and [Godwoken](https://docs.godwoken.io).
